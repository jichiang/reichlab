In writing a blog post for this framework, there are a few important things to remember. First, let's cover FRONT MATTER.

There are two fields that you **need**, the *TITLE* and the *LAYOUT*. Clearly, *TITLE* is the title of your blog post and *LAYOUT* is a bit more complicated, but for now, we will use *post*. Here is an example:

<pre><code>--- 
title: Title of Blog Post  
layout: post  
---

Content goes here! 
</code></pre>

**Remember**, three hyphens must be displayed at the line before and after this front matter. If you have ever written a file in Rmarkdown, then you are already familiar with this. Also, one should note that if special characters are being used in the front matter, then the phrase must be encased in quotes (for example, a colon or an ampersand are special characters).

Lastly, when saving the files, they are formatted as such:  

<pre><code>
YYYY-MM-DD-[POST SLUG].FORMAT  

</code></pre>

We see the date followed by the post-slug, which refers to a URL-friendly format for the post's name. So, take this post for example. It was written on July 9th, 2015 followed by the name "test-post". Dashes separate the dates and the words. Thus, we have the following:

<pre><code>
2015-07-09-test-post.html

</code></pre>

In the site's directory, you'll store future posts in the `_posts` folder.
