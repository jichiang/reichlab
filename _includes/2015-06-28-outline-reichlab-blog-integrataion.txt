Projected timeline to integrate Bootstrap CSS w/ Jekyll for ReichLab website
(with estimated time required)


- Fork reichlab repo to another GitHub repo that is hosted using GitHub pages. this will ensure that we can test updates. (1 hr)
	- github pages...I've seen this but thought it was easier to use "...github.io". Is this what Nick may mean? 
	- Either way, I'll try it on my page: shv38339.github.io

- migrate forked Reich Lab website into a jekyll framework. no blog, just editable pages in .md format, existing styles preserved. (6 hrs)
	- I don't think this will be possible as much of it is already tied to the css and html.
	- What is in a Jekyll format are the following directories/files:
		- _includes
			- header.html, footer.html
		- _layouts
			- default.html, post.html
		- _posts
			- testpost.md
		- archive.md
			- simple markdown page written in Liquid to store all blog posts
		- _config.yml
			- need to explore these options but wonder if they may interfere with css

- integrate blog into forked Reich Lab site. includes blog landing page, blog entry template, one test blog post. (10 hours) 
	- unsure of what this may mean other than Nick forking the directory into his own. 

- test site, check that rest of site remains the same as it was, launch new site (3 hours)
 - write-up tutorial to write a blog for BLOG folder
 - write-up tutorial on different types of blog posts (with code, pictures, mobile, etc-
